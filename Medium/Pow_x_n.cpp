Problem: Pow(x, n) (LC #50)
================================

Problem Statement:
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xⁿ).

Approach Used:
Binary Exponentiation (Exponentiation by Squaring)
- Convert n into a long integer to handle overflow cases.
- If n is negative, invert x and make n positive.
- Repeatedly square the base and multiply it to the result
  when the current exponent bit is 1.
- Divide the exponent by 2 at each step.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Why This Approach?
Binary exponentiation reduces the number of multiplications from O(n)
to O(log n), making it highly efficient for large powers.

Concepts Used:
Binary Exponentiation, Bit Manipulation, Math
